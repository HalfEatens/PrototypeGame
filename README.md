**Combat system:** 
Initially will be like Pokemon, however we will change to be more like Naruto online mixed with a few other games.


## To do list:

 - Create different stats
 - Types system (Different classes deal dmg to other ones like rock paper scissors)
 - "chase passive" ability that follows a certain attack status.
(statuses would be like push, pull, knock down and knock up)
 - More complex abilities (inc damage over time)
 - Passives
 - Ult system (team combo)
 - Buffs
 - Simple starter item system
 -
