# Game Prototype

## Please ignore current UI and how things work

**Combat system:** 
Initially will be like Pokemon, however we will change to be more like Naruto online mixed with a few other games.


## To do list:

- Convert to 2D (easy)
- add proper attacks and abilities
- setup misc stats and give them proper functionality
- figure out the mathematical functions for all the stats
- implement types (striker, powerhouse ect)
- team ult ability


- Change how the combat system works (make more like naruto online) (probs gonna be difficult at first but the base is there)


- start creating characters, sfx and animations
- setup the animations (probs will be annoying)


- debuffs and buffs
- add more abilities maybe some skills and passives too
- maybe create a simple item system


- completely change UI
- cards system
- level up system
- star system (forge cards)


- banana cards


- more gamemodes
- world, shop, story, things to do, mini games, skins ect. idk
